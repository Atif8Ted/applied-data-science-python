# Applied Data Science with Python

Here are the course files from the Coursera Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. This is a University of Michigan MOOC.

I'm running the `.ipynb` files either:
* online on Coursera or
* offline using [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).

My code can be found in the 'Assignment' `.ipynb` files.

_Notes & assignments left to add: plotting-charting week 4._
